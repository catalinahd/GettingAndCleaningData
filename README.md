# GettingAndCleaningData
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to reproduce this project:
1.I recommend using Rstudio to open the R script run_analysis.r (if there is any aeeror it will be easier to debug step by step)
Otherwise you can use a text editor to open the run_analysis.r file.
2.The Script is creating a "Data" folder inside the R working directory. 

Outputs produced
The script will create the file "tidydata.txt" at the working directory as an output. This file is the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
